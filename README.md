<h1 align="center">Observing Network Traffic and Network Security Group (NSG) Functions Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>

This project focuses on analyzing network traffic between two Azure virtual machines using Wireshark and PowerShell. It also demonstrates how Network Security Groups (NSGs) can control traffic flow between resources in a virtual network.

  <img src="images/an-2.jpg" width="750" alt="Remote Desktop setup screen" />
</p>

- Enter the login credentials created during VM setup.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/an-3.jpg" width="750" alt="RDP login credentials" />
</p>

- You‚Äôll now have access to the Windows VM desktop.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/an-4.jpg" width="750" alt="Windows VM RDP session active" />
</p>

- Open **Microsoft Edge** in the VM and download Wireshark from [Wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org).
- Install Wireshark using the default settings.

  <img src="images/an-5.jpg" width="750" alt="Downloading and installing Wireshark" />
</p>

<h2>üì° Step 2: Monitor ICMP Traffic Between Virtual Machines</h2>

- Launch **Wireshark** on the Windows VM.
- Select the active **Ethernet** adapter and click the **shark fin icon** to begin capturing.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/icmp1.jpg" width="750" alt="Starting packet capture in Wireshark" />
</p>

- Apply the filter `icmp` to isolate ICMP traffic.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/icmp2.jpg" width="750" alt="Wireshark ICMP traffic filter" />
</p>

- In the Azure Portal, navigate to the Linux VM‚Äôs **Networking** tab and copy its **Private IP address**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/icmp3.jpg" width="750" alt="Linux VM private IP address in Azure" />
</p>

- In PowerShell on the Windows VM, run: `ping <Linux-Private-IP>`

You‚Äôll observe ICMP packets in Wireshark and replies in PowerShell, confirming successful communication between the two VMs.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>Opening PowerShell</strong></td>
    <td align="center"><strong>ICMP Traffic in Wireshark</strong></td>
    <td align="center"><strong>Ping Output in PowerShell</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/icmp4.jpg" width="300" alt="Opening PowerShell" /></td>
    <td><img src="images/icmp6.png" width="300" alt="ICMP traffic in Wireshark" /></td>
    <td><img src="images/icmp5.png" width="300" alt="Ping in PowerShell" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

- For continuous monitoring, run: `ping <Linux-Private-IP> -t`

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/icmp6.jpg" width="750" alt="Continuous ICMP traffic" />
</p>

---

<h2>üõ°Ô∏è Step 3: Block ICMP Traffic Using Network Security Group (NSG)</h2>

- While the continuous ping is running, open the **Linux VM > Networking > Network security group** in Azure.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/nsg1.jpg" width="750" alt="Open NSG for Linux VM" />
</p>

- Click **Inbound security rules > + Add**, and configure the following:

```
Source: Any
Source Port Ranges: *
Destination: Any
Destination Port Ranges: *
Protocol: ICMPv4
Action: Deny
Priority: 290
Name: Deny-ICMP
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/nsg2.jpg" width="750" alt="Adding NSG rule to block ICMP" />
</p>

- Return to the Windows VM ‚Äî ping requests will now **time out** and ICMP traffic will stop.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>Ping Timeout in PowerShell</strong></td>
    <td align="center"><strong>ICMP Blocked in Wireshark</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/nsg3.jpg" width="360" alt="Ping timeout in PowerShell" /></td>
    <td><img src="images/nsg5.jpg" width="360" alt="Blocked ICMP packets in Wireshark" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

> ‚úÖ NSGs act as firewalls at the VM or subnet level, allowing or denying traffic based on rules.

---

<h2>üîÑ Step 4: Remove NSG Rule and Resume ICMP Communication</h2>

- In Azure, go back to the **Inbound rules** and delete the `Deny-ICMP` rule.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/nsg6.jpg" width="750" alt="Deleting Deny-ICMP NSG rule" />
</p>

- The ping will resume almost immediately in PowerShell and Wireshark.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>ICMP Replies in PowerShell</strong></td>
    <td align="center"><strong>ICMP Resumed in Wireshark</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/nsg7.jpg" width="360" alt="Ping replies returned" /></td>
    <td><img src="images/nsg8.jpg" width="360" alt="ICMP reply packets in Wireshark" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>üîê Step 5: Observe SSH and DHCP Traffic</h2>

### üî∏ Observe SSH Traffic

SSH (Secure Shell) is used to securely access Linux systems remotely over the network. In this step, we'll observe encrypted SSH packets between the Windows and Linux VMs.

- Open **Wireshark** and apply the filter: `ssh`. Then start a new packet capture session.
- On the Windows VM, open **PowerShell** and initiate a secure SSH session:

```powershell
ssh <username>@<Linux-Private-IP>
```

üìå Replace `<username>` and `<Linux-Private-IP>` with your actual Linux credentials.

- When prompted, type `yes` to confirm the connection, then enter the Linux VM password.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ssh1.jpg" width="750" alt="SSH connection from PowerShell" />
</p>

- You'll now be logged into the Linux VM via the terminal. Wireshark will display encrypted SSH traffic packets.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ssh2.jpg" width="750" alt="Encrypted SSH packets in Wireshark" />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ssh3.jpg" width="750" alt="More SSH packets in Wireshark" />
</p>

- Once done, type `exit` in PowerShell to close the SSH session.

> üõ°Ô∏è SSH encrypts both authentication and session data, making it ideal for secure system administration and data integrity.

### üî∏ Observe DHCP Traffic

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is used to assign dynamic IP addresses to devices. In Azure, VMs are assigned reserved dynamic IPs via DHCP.

Releasing an IP address manually using `ipconfig /release` can disconnect your RDP session. Instead, we‚Äôll simulate DHCP traffic using a batch script that automates both release and renew operations.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step DHCP Simulation

1. **Open Notepad** in the Windows VM and write the following lines:

```plaintext
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
```

2. **Save the file** as `dhcp.bat` in the path `C:\ProgramData`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dhcp1.jpg" width="750" alt="Creating DHCP batch script" />
</p>

3. Open **Wireshark**, apply the filter: `dhcp`, and start a new capture.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dhcp2.jpg" width="750" alt="Wireshark DHCP filter" />
</p>

4. In **PowerShell**, navigate to the script location and execute it:

```powershell
cd C:\ProgramData
ls
.\dhcp.bat
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dhcp3.2.jpg" width="750" alt="Running DHCP script in PowerShell" />
</p>

- During execution, the VM will momentarily release and renew its IP address. This activity will be captured as DHCP discover, offer, request, and acknowledgment packets in Wireshark.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dhcp4.jpg" width="750" alt="DHCP traffic in Wireshark" />
</p>

> üí° This process demonstrates how DHCP leasing works behind the scenes in Azure, and provides hands-on experience with IP assignment protocols ‚Äî a vital networking concept for cloud and security engineers.


<h2>üåê Step 6: Analyze DNS and RDP Traffic</h2>

### üî∏ DNS Traffic

- In Wireshark, apply filter `dns` and run in PowerShell:  
  `nslookup disney.com`

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dns1.png" width="750" alt="DNS lookup in PowerShell" />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dns2.jpg" width="750" alt="DNS query packets in Wireshark" />
</p>

---

### üî∏ RDP Traffic

- Apply filter `tcp.port == 3389` in Wireshark.  
  You'll see consistent encrypted traffic during your RDP session.

<h2>‚úÖ Conclusion</h2>

In this project, we created two Azure virtual machines ‚Äî one Windows and one Linux ‚Äî and used them to explore and analyze real-time network traffic using Wireshark and PowerShell.

We examined protocols like **ICMP**, **SSH**, **RDP**, **DNS**, and **DHCP**, and tested how **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** control traffic flow between VMs.

This hands-on experience deepened our understanding of cloud networking, traffic analysis, and security rule implementation ‚Äî all essential skills in IT and cybersecurity roles.
