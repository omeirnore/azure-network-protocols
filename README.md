<h1>Observing Network Traffic and Network Security Group (NSG) Functions Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>

This project focuses on analyzing network traffic between two Azure virtual machines using Wireshark and PowerShell. It also demonstrates how Network Security Groups (NSGs) can control traffic flow between resources in a virtual network.
<h2>üß∞ Prerequisite</h2>

- [Creating Virtual Machines in Azure](https://github.com/omeirnore/VirtualMachine-Creation)
 <h2>üñ•Ô∏è Environments and Tools Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines, Networking, NSGs)
- Remote Desktop (RDP on Windows 11)
- PowerShell
- Wireshark (Network Protocol Analyzer)
- Network Protocols Observed: SSH, RDP, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP, DHCP

<h2>üßë‚Äçüíª Operating Systems Used</h2>

- Windows 11 (host system)
- Windows 10 Pro (22H2) [VM]
- Ubuntu Server 22.04 [VM]
<h2>üîå Step 1: Connect to Windows VM and Install Wireshark</h2>

- Start by logging into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigating to the **Virtual Machines** section.

- Select both the Windows and Linux VMs and click the **Start** button to power them on.  
  *Note: Make a note of the **public IP address** of your Windows VM ‚Äî you'll need it shortly.*

  </p>

- Once the VMs are running, open the **Remote Desktop Connection** tool in Windows.

- In the **Computer** field, enter the public IP address of your Windows VM and click Connect.

  </p>

- Enter the **username and password** you set up for the VM during deployment.

  </p>
- Now you will be able to access and use the Windows VM

  </p>
- Once connected, open **Microsoft Edge** in the Windows VM and navigate to [Wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org).

- Download the **Windows x64 Installer**, run the setup, and complete the installation with default options.

  <h2>üì° Step 2: Monitor ICMP Traffic Between Virtual Machines</h2>

- Launch **Wireshark** inside the Windows VM.

- From the list of available interfaces, select the active **Ethernet adapter**, then click the **shark fin icon** to begin packet capture.

  <!-- Screenshot: Start Wireshark capture -->

- In the filter bar at the top, type `icmp` and press **Enter** to isolate only ICMP packets (used by ping).

- In the **Azure Portal**, navigate to your **Linux VM**, select **Networking**, and copy its **Private IP address**.

  <!-- Screenshot: Linux VM private IP -->

- Switch back to the Windows VM and open **PowerShell**.

- Use the following command to ping the Linux VM:
  ```powershell
  ping <Linux-Private-IP>
